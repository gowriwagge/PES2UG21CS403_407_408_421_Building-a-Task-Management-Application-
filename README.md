# BUILDING A TASK MANAGEMENT API USING RAFT CONSENSUS	
•	Developed a fault-tolerant distributed key-value store using the Raft consensus algorithm, ensuring leader election, log replication, and fault tolerance for high availability.

•	Designed and implemented RESTful APIs for client-server communication and integrated MySQL for backend data storage to support efficient key-value operations

# OBJECTIVE
Implement a task management system with Raft consensus algorithm for distributed coordination.

Utilise MySQL as the backend database to store task data.

Ensure fault tolerance and consistency across multiple nodes using Raft.

Enable users to perform CRUD operations on tasks via a user-friendly interface.

Demonstrate distributed system principles and fault tolerance mechanisms through the application.
